# Link Site

This is a very simple HTML template to create a list of personal links. Similar to a basic linktree style site.
It uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) to give the icons for the links.

It was initially based on [this template](https://github.com/Harindulk/custom-links-page) but it included more then I needed.
This is strictly HTML and CSS with the Font Awesome stylesheet added.
